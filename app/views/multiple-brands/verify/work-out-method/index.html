        <p>Certified companies have built new, secure systems to verify identities. These systems work by checking:</p>

        <ul class="list list-bullet">
          <li>your identity documents are valid</li>
          <li>it’s you providing your details, and not someone pretending to be you</li>
        </ul>

        <p>However, each company uses different methods for each of these steps.</p>

        <p>So we’ll now ask you some questions to check which companies can verify you. We’ll then send you to the website of the company you choose.</p>
